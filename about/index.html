	<h1>About</h1>
	<ul style="margin-left: -40px"><p>Starting as a hardware hacking blog, ryanbaekr quickly turned into a place for keyboard layout experimentation. When I entered the mechanical keyboard scene, I discovered that many of the keyboard layouts I wanted to try simply didn't exist on the market. Using my electrical and computer engineering background I brought these layouts to life, and now, being confident in the quality of my designs, I'm ready to offer them to you! The kits offered by ryanbaekr serve as affordable yet feature rich introductions to the more exotic layouts you're itching to try.</p></u1>
